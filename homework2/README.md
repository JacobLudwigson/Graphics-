LORENZ ATTRACTOR INSTUCTIONS: 
    To adjust lorenz parameters simply press the lower case character of the parameter you wish to adjust (s,b,r) and press (+,-) to increase or decrease the paramter by 0.5.
    To orient the picture use the up, down, left, right arrow keys as necessary. 

Most of the functions for this assignment were taken from ex6. The lorenz points were graphed using the iterative algorithm given with homework 2. 

In addition to getting the code from ex6 to work with the lorenz attractor code, I added a color gradient across the points in the attrator, Z depth testing, and a larger Z buffer in the orthogonal projection so that the function is seemingly infinite even though it gets cut off the picture at z values beyond 1000 and -1000. 

To see the color gradient as well as the depth testing more clearly, view the attractor at s = 10, b = 2.666, r = 22.0.
